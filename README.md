I just start to use github, so it`s difficult to coordinate files. Please, choose branch with latest version of project.

The latest version: version2 - add search_by_name function and insert. The way of showing info from tables was changed too: use pandas to convert tables to dataframes.

Previous versions:
version1 - function of select was added.
